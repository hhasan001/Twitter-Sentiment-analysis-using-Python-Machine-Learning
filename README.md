# Twitter-sentiment-analysis-using-Python-Machine-Learning-Project
Sentiment analysis is a research area in Natural Language Processing that aims to identify the opinions, attitudes or emotions expressed in a text document or sentence,
often with respect to a particular topic.
In this project, We will be analysing the sentiment of people towards Pfizer vaccines. We will be using the data available on Kaggle to create this machine learning model. The collected tweets from Twitter will be analysed using machine learning to identify the different sentiments present in the tweets. The different sentiments identified in this project include positive sentiment, negative sentiment and neutral sentiment. We will also be using different classifiers to see which classifier gives the best model accuracy.
